/*
Table: Logs

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| num         | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
 

Write an SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example:

 

Logs table:
+----+-----+
| Id | Num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+

Result table:
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.

--solution 1: use three logs to get consecutive numbers (but if n > 3, it will be ugly, someone mentioned windows function)
Select Distinct l1.Num AS ConsecutiveNums
From 
  Logs l1, Logs l2, Logs l3
Where
  l1.Id = l2.Id - 1
  AND l2.Id = l3.Id - 1
  AND l1.Num = l2.Num
  AND l2.Num = l3.Num;
