/*
Write a SQL query to rank scores. If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking. Note that after a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no "holes" between ranks.

+----+-------+
| Id | Score |
+----+-------+
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |
+----+-------+
For example, given the above Scores table, your query should generate the following report (order by highest score):

+-------+---------+
| score | Rank    |
+-------+---------+
| 4.00  | 1       |
| 4.00  | 1       |
| 3.85  | 2       |
| 3.65  | 3       |
| 3.65  | 3       |
| 3.50  | 4       |
+-------+---------+
Important Note: For MySQL solutions, to escape reserved words used as column names, you can use an apostrophe before and after the keyword. For example `Rank`.

-- solution 1:
Select Score, 
  (Select count(*) FROM (Select distinct Score s From Scores) tmp WHERE s >= Score) `Rank`
FROM Scores
Order By Score desc

-- Solution 2:
Select s.Score, count(distinct t.Score) `Rank`
From Scores s Join Scores t ON s.Score <= t.Score
Group by s.Id
Order by s.Score desc
